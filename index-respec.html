<p>Privacy and Identification on the Web have been at the center of how we
interact with sites on the Web. The explosion of Websites over the last decade
and a half has created a point of pain for anyone that uses the Web on a
regular basis. Remembering login details, passwords,
and sharing private information across the many websites that people use on a
daily basis has become more difficult and complicated than necessary. This 
specification outlines a simple universal identification mechanism that is
distributed, openly extensible, improves privacy, security and control over how 
one can identify themselves on the Web.</p>

<h2>How to Read this Document</h2>
  
<p>There are a number of concepts that are covered in this document that the
reader may want to be aware of before continuing. General knowledge of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_cryptography">public key cryptography</a> 
is necessary to understand how to implement this specification. 
WebID also uses HTTP over TLS [[!HTTP-TLS]], X.509 certificates
[[!X509V3]], and RDFa [[!RDFA-CORE]].</p>

<p>A general <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a> is provided for all that
would like to understand why this specification is necessary to simplify usage
of the Web.</p>

<p>The terms used throughout this specification are listed in the section
titled <a href="#terminology">Terminology</a>.</p>

<section class='informative'>
<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
The WebID specification is designed to help alleviate the difficultly that
remembering different logins, passwords and settings for websites has created. 
It is also designed to provide a universal and extensible mechanism to express 
public and private information about yourself. This section outlines the 
motivation behind the specification and the relationship to other similar 
specifications that are in active use today.
</p>

<section class='informative'>
<h1>Motivation</h1>

<p>
It is a fundamental design criteria of the Web to enable individuals and
organizations to control how they interact with the rest of society. This
includes how one expresses their identity, public information and personal 
details to social networks, Web sites and services.
</p>

<p>
Semantic Web vocabularies such as Friend-of-a-Friend (FOAF) permit distributed 
hyperlinked social networks to exist. This vocabulary, along with other 
vocabularies, allow one to add information and services protection to 
distributed social networks.
</p>

<p>
One major criticism of open networks is that they seem to have no way of
protecting the personal information distributed on the web or limiting
access to resources. Few people are willing to make all their personal
information public, many would like large pieces to be protected, making
it available only to a select group of agents. Giving access to
information is very similar to giving access to services. There are many
occasions when people would like services to only be accessible to
members of a group, such as allowing only friends, family members,
colleagues to post an article, photo or comment on a blog. How does one do
this in a flexible way, without requiring a central point of
access control?
</p>

<p>
Using an process made popular by OpenID, we show how one can tie a User
Agent to a URL by proving that one has write access to the URL. WebID is
a simpler alternative to OpenID (fewer connections), that uses X.509 
certificates to tie a User Agent (Browser) to a Person identified via a URL. 
WebID also provides a few additional features to OpenID. These
features include trust management, via digital signatures, and free-form 
extensibility via RDFa. By using the existing SSL certificate exchange
mechanism, WebID integrates more smoothly with existing Web browsers, including
browsers on mobile devices. WebID also permits automated session login
in addition to interactive session login. Additionally, all data is encrypted
and guaranteed to only be received by the person or organization that was 
intended to receive it.
</p>

</section>

<section class='informative'>
<h1>Relation to OpenID</h1>

<p>While some may say that OpenID and WebID conflict, WebID is 100% compatible
with OpenID since both use a URL for identification. Therefore, WebID does not
intend to replace OpenID, but can work beside OpenID just as easily as providing
a complete solution. That said, there are a number of benefits that WebID
achieves over OpenID:
</p>

<p>WebID gives people and other agents a Web ID URL for identification, just
like OpenId does. However, in the case of WebID, the user does not need to
remember the URL, the browser or User Agent does. A login button on a
WebID web site is just a button. No need to enter any identifier like one
has to for OpenID. Just click the button. Your browser will then ask you what 
identity you wish to use. The person that is browsing does not need to 
remember either the WebID URL or the website password. The only password one
needs to remember is the one that is used to access their collection of
WebIDs in their browser.</p>

<p>The WebID protocol requires just one direct network connection to establish
identity via the client. The server requires one connection to the client and
one connection to retrieve the WebID URL if it does not have the credential
information cached. Compare this to the much more complex OpenID sequence, which
requires six connections by the client to establish a login. In a world of 
distributed data where each site can point to data on any other site, multiple 
connections become costly to manage.</p>

<p>WebID builds on well established Internet and Web standards;
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">REST</a>, 
RDF [[RDF-PRIMER]], RDFa [[!RDFA-CORE]], TLS [[!HTTP-TLS]], and X.509 
[[!X509V3]]. By building on previous standards, it makes both explaining and 
implementing WebID easier on developers.</p>

<p>Since WebID is RESTful, you can perform basic HTTP operations to 
<code>GET</code> your WebID, and if you needed update it, you can use
HTTP <code>PUT</code> semantics. You can also create a WebID via 
<code>POST</code>. This is improved from the OpenID specification, which
requires a new set of operations described in the OpenID Attribute Exchange
specification.</p>

<p>It is easy to extend a WebID with new attributes via RDF. The power of
RDF and RDFa allows developers to add extensions to WebID by defining new
vocabularies that they publish. There is no authorization process necessary
and thus WebID allows for distributed innovation. Every WebID property is
a URI, which when clicked, can give you yet more information about what the
property means. A developer can create new usage classes by extending their
vocabulary at will. A developer can add relationships to a WebID by simply
adding more HTML to the developer's page. OpenID does not provide any type of
distributed innovation akin to RDF or RDFa.</p>

<p>WebID is built on RDF and thus enables all of the advanced semantic web
concepts that RDF enables. For example, a developer may perform machine
reasoning with a WebID. One can construct machine-executable statements like
"If this WebID claims to be a friend of one of our partner WebIDs that is
trusted and the relationship is bi-directional, trust the WebID." 
While OpenID attempts to support this use case by mapping OpenID to RDF, it's
far easier to do with WebID because WebID is natively RDF-aware.</p>

<p>Implementing WebID is easier than OpenID because all of the basic 
technologies have been working and integrated into Web browsers for many years. 
There were already three interoperable implementations of WebID before this 
specification was written.</p>

<p>WebID is truly decentralized - with WebID you get a web of trust. 
OpenID only supports the Web of Trust model if you indirectly trust the
OpenID provider. In other words - OpenID is not truly decentralized. In OpenID
you must trust OpenID providers. With WebID you only have to trust the people
and the organizations with which you are communicating. In other words, you
don't have to ask anyone whether or not you can trust your friends. You can
query people that you trust directly to see if someone is trustworthy or not.
There is no need for a central WebID authority.
</p>

<p>WebID is fully distributed, anyone can setup a WebID by placing a single
file on a web server of their choosing. There is no need for a special 
OpenID-like provider service. The only thing anyone that wants a WebID needs
is a web account where you can post your WebID file, ideally on your own domain 
name. You can also use a WebID hosting provider, but it's not necessary for
WebID to work. While it is possible to run an OpenID server, other
OpenID applications may not trust you and thus you won't be able to fully
utilize your private OpenID credentials. The reason that there are a few
large OpenID providers and very few small OpenID providers is because of this
trust design issue related to OpenID.</p>

<p>WebID does not require HTTP redirects. Redirects are are problematic on many
cell phones, because telecoms heavily rely on proxys, which selectively block
redirects.</p>

<p>A WebID provider is 100% compatible with an OpenID provider and thus can 
inter-operate with OpenID-powered networks.</p>

<h1>Relation to OAuth</h1>

<p>
OAuth and WebID are mutually beneficial when used together. WebID can be
used to provide RSA parameters to the RSA-SHA1 signature method required by
OAuth 1.0. WebID can also be used to establish the consumer_key and HTTPS 
connection that will be used to transmit OAuth Tokens in OAuth 2.0.

<h1>Authentication Sequence</h1>

<p>The following steps are executed by Verification Agents and Identification
Agents to determine if access should be granted to a particular resource.
</p>

<ol>
<li>The <tref>Identification Agent</tref> attempts to access a resource
using HTTP over TLS [[!HTTP-TLS]] via the <tref>Verification Agent</tref>.</li>

<li>The <tref>Verification Agent</tref> MUST request the 
<tref>Identification Certificate</tref> of the <tref>Identification Agent</tref>
as a part of the TLS client-cerificate retrieval protocol.</li>

<li>The <tref>Verification Agent</tref> MUST extract the <tref>WebID URL</tref> 
contained in the <code>Subject Alternative Name</code> field of the 
<tref>Identification Certificate</tref>. The <tref>WebID URL</tref> MUST be 
dereferenced and the resulting document processed according to [[!XHTML-RDFA]]. 
All triples pertaining to the public key associated with the 
<tref>WebID URL</tref> MUST be extracted from the remote document.</li>

<li>The remote document triples MUST be queried for information about the 
public key contained in the <tref>Identification Certificate</tref>. 
If the public key in the certificate is found in the list of public keys 
associated with the <tref>WebID URL</tref>, the <tref>Verification Agent</tref>
MUST assume that the client has write access to the <tref>WebID URL</tref> and
therefore owns the URL.</li>

<li>At this point, the <tref>Verification Agent</tref> has verified that the
<tref>WebID URL</tref> is owned by the <tref>Identification Agent</tref>. The
<tref>Verification Agent</tref> MUST use the now verified public key contained 
in the <tref>Identification Certificate</tref> for all TLS-based communication
with the <tref>Identification Agent</tref>.
</ol>

<p>
The <tref>Identification Agent</tref> MAY re-establish a different identity at 
any time by executing all of the steps in the Authentication Sequence again. 
Additional algorithms, detailed in the next section, MAY be performed to 
determine if the <tref>Verification Agent</tref> can access a particular 
resource after the last step of the Authentication Sequence has been
completed.</li>

<h2>Extracting Identification URL Details</h2>

<p>
The <tref>Verification Agent</tref> may use a number of different methods to
extract the public key information from the <tref>WebID URL</tref>.
</p>
The following SPARQL query outlines one way in which the public key
could be extracted from the <tref>WebID URL</tref>:
<code><pre>
PREFIX cert: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/cert#&gt;
PREFIX rsa: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/rsa#&gt;
SELECT ?modulus ?exp
WHERE {
   ?key cert:identity &lt;http://example.org/webid#public&gt;;
      a rsa:RSAPublicKey;
      rsa:modulus [ cert:hex ?modulus; ];
      rsa:public_exponent [ cert:decimal ?exp ] .
}
