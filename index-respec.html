<p>Social networking, identity and privacy have been at the center of how we 
interact with the Web in the last decade. The explosion of social networking 
sites has brought the world closer together as well as created new points of
pain regarding ease of use and the Web. Remembering login details, passwords,
and sharing private information across the many websites and social groups
that we are a part of has become more difficult and complicated than necessary. 
The Social Web is designed to ensure that control of identity and privacy 
settings is always simple and under one's control. WebID is a key enabler of the 
Social Web. This specification outlines a simple universal identification 
mechanism that is distributed, openly extensible, improves privacy, security 
and control over how one can identify themselves and control access to their 
information on the Web.

<h2>How to Read this Document</h2>
  
<p>There are a number of concepts that are covered in this document that the
reader may want to be aware of before continuing. General knowledge of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_cryptography">public key cryptography</a> 
and RDF [[!RDF-PRIMER]] and RDFa [[!RDFA-CORE]] is necessary to understand how 
to implement this specification. WebID uses a number of specific technologies 
like HTTP over TLS [[!HTTP-TLS]], X.509 certificates [[!X509V3]], 
RDF/XML [[!RDF-SYNTAX-GRAMMAR]] and XHTML+RDFa [[!XHTML-RDFA]].</p>

<p>A general <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a> is provided for all that
would like to understand why this specification is necessary to simplify usage
of the Web.</p>

<p>The terms used throughout this specification are listed in the section
titled <a href="#terminology">Terminology</a>.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
The WebID specification is designed to help alleviate the difficultly that
remembering different logins, passwords and settings for websites has created. 
It is also designed to provide a universal and extensible mechanism to express 
public and private information about yourself. This section outlines the 
motivation behind the specification and the relationship to other similar 
specifications that are in active use today.
</p>

<section class='informative'>
<h1>Motivation</h1>

<p>
It is a fundamental design criteria of the Web to enable individuals and
organizations to control how they interact with the rest of society. This
includes how one expresses their identity, public information and personal 
details to social networks, Web sites and services.
</p>

<p>
Semantic Web vocabularies such as Friend-of-a-Friend (FOAF) permit distributed 
hyperlinked social networks to exist. This vocabulary, along with other 
vocabularies, allow one to add information and services protection to 
distributed social networks.
</p>

<p>
One major criticism of open networks is that they seem to have no way of
protecting the personal information distributed on the web or limiting
access to resources. Few people are willing to make all their personal
information public, many would like large pieces to be protected, making
it available only to a selected group of agents. Giving access to
information is very similar to giving access to services. There are many
occasions when people would like services to only be accessible to
members of a group, such as allowing only friends, family members,
colleagues to post an article, photo or comment on a blog. How does one do
this in a flexible way, without requiring a central point of
access control?
</p>

<p>
Using a process made popular by OpenID, we show how one can tie a User
Agent to a URI by proving that one has write access to the URI.
WebID is an authentication protocol which uses X.509 
certificates to associate a User Agent (Browser) to a Person identified via a URI.
WebID is compatible with OpenID and provides a few additional features such as
trust management via digital signatures, and free-form 
extensibility via RDF. By using the existing SSL certificate exchange
mechanism, WebID integrates smoothly with existing Web browsers, including
browsers on mobile devices. WebID also permits automated session login
in addition to interactive session login. Additionally, all data is encrypted
and guaranteed to only be received by the person or organization that was 
intended to receive it.

<dl>

<dt><tdef>Verification Agent</tdef></dt>
<dd>Performs authentication on provided WebID credentials and determines if
an <tref>Identification Agent</tref> can have access to a particular 
resource. A <tref>Verification Agent</tref> is typically a Web server, but 
may also be a peer on a peer-to-peer network.</dd>

<dt><tdef>Identification Agent</tdef></dt>
<dd>Provides identification credentials to a <tref>Verification Agent</tref>. The
<tref>Identification Agent</tref> is typically also a User Agent.</dd>

<dt><tdef>Identification Certificate</tdef></dt>
<dd>An X.509 [[!X509V3]] Certificate that MUST contain a 
<code>Subject Alternative Name</code> extension with a URI entry. The URI
identifies the <tref>Identification Agent</tref>. The URI SHOULD be
dereference-able and result in a document containing RDF data. For example, 
the certificate would contain <code>http://example.org/webid#public</code>,
known as a <tref>WebID URI</tref>, as the <code>Subject Alternative Name</code>:

<h1>Creating the certificate</h1>

<p>The user agent will create an X.509 Certificate with a Subject Alternative Name URI. The URI must be one that points to a document the user controls, as he will have to add information to that document at that URI. </p>
<p>Suppose for sake of example that the X.509 Certificate contains the public key
<p>Example: 
  User controls http://joe.example/profile then his WebID can be
  http://joe.example/profile#me
</p>
<p>As an example to use throughout this specification here is the 
following certificate as an output of the openssl program.</p>

<h1>Authentication Sequence</h1>

<p>The following steps are executed by <tref>Verification Agent</tref>s and
<tref>Identification Agent</tref>s to determine the global identity of the
requesting agent. Once this is known, the identity can be used to determine
if access should be granted to the requested resource.
</p>

<ol>
<li>The <tref>Identification Agent</tref> attempts to access a resource
using HTTP over TLS [[!HTTP-TLS]] via the <tref>Verification Agent</tref>.</li>

<li>The <tref>Verification Agent</tref> MUST request the 
<tref>Identification Certificate</tref> of the <tref>Identification Agent</tref>
as a part of the TLS client-certificate retrieval protocol.</li>

<li>The <tref>Verification Agent</tref> MUST extract the <tref>public key</tref> and the
<tref>WebID URI</tref> contained in the <code>Subject Alternative Name</code>
extension of the <tref>Identification Certificate</tref>.
<p class="issue">There may be more than one URI in the SAN</p></li>

<li>
The <tref>Verification Agent</tref> verifies that the 
<tref>Identification Agent</tref> owns the private key corresponding to the public key  sent in the 
<tref>Identification Certificate</tref>. This SHOULD be fulfilled by performing TLS mutual-authentication
between the <tref>Verification Agent</tref> and the 
<tref>Identification Agent</tref>. 
If the <tref>Verification Agent</tref> does not have access to the TLS layer, 
a digital signature challenge MAY be provided by the 
<tref>Verification Agent</tref>. These processes are detailed in the section
on  
<a href="#secure-communication">Secure Communication</a>.
<p class="issue">We don't have any implementations for this second way of doing 
things, so this is still hypothetical. Implementations using TLS mutual-authentication are many</p>
</li>

<li>The meaning of the 
<tref>WebID URI</tref> is a graph of relations that is fetched by the <tref>Verification Agent</tref> 
either by dereferencing the <tref>WebID URI</tref> and 
extracting RDF data from the resulting document, or by utilizing a cached 
version of the RDF data contained in the document or other data source that is 
up-to-date and trusted by the <tref>Verification Agent</tref>. The processing
 mechanism is further detailed in the sections titled 
<a href="#processing-the-webid-profile">Processing the WebID Profile</a>
</li>

<li>If the <tref>public key</tref> in the 
<tref>Identification Certificate</tref> matches one in the set given by the
profile document graph given above then the <tref>Verification Agent</tref>
knows that the <tref>Identification Agent</tref> is indeed identified by the
<tref>WebID URI</tref>. The verification is done by querying the 
Personal Profile graph as specified in <a href="#extracting-webid-uri-details">querying the RDF graph</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The <tref>Identification Agent</tref> MAY re-establish a different identity at 
any time by executing all of the steps in the Authentication Sequence again.

<h2>Processing the WebID Profile</h2>

<p>A <tref>Verification Agent</tref> MUST be able to process documents in RDF/XML 
[[!RDF-SYNTAX-GRAMMAR]] and XHTML+RDFa [[!XHTML-RDFA]]. A server responding to 
a <tref>WebID Profile</tref> request SHOULD be able to deliver at least RDF/XML
or RDFa. The <tref>Verification Agent</tref> MUST set the Accept-Header to request
<code>application/rdf+xml</code> with a higher priority than <code>text/html</code>
and <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>. If the server answers such a request
with an HTML representation of the resource, this SHOULD describe the WebId Profile
with RDFa.
</p> 

<p class="issue">This section will explain how a Verification Agent extracts 
semantic data describing the identification credentials from a WebID Profile.</p>
</section>

<section class='normative'>
<h2>Verifying the WebID is identified by that public key</h2>

<p>
The <tref>Verification Agent</tref> must check that the <tref>WebID Profile</tref> associates the WebID with the public key given in the X.509 Certificate. There are number of ways of doing this, each of which essentially consists in checking that the graph of relations in the Profile contain a pattern of relations.
</p>
<p>Assuming the public key is an RSA key, and that its modulus is
 "9D79BFE2498..." and exponent "65537" then the query to ask the graph is
</p>
<pre class='example'>
PREFIX cert: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/cert#&gt;
PREFIX rsa: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/rsa#&gt;
ASK {
   [] cert:identity &lt;http://example.org/webid#public&gt;;
      rsa:modulus  "9D79BFE2498..."^^cert:hex;
      rsa:public_exponent "65537"^^cert:int .
}
</pre>
<p>If the query returns true, then the graph has validated the associated public key with the WebID.</p>
<p>The above requires the graph to be able to do inferencing on dataytypes. This is because people may publish their modulus string in a number of syntactical ways. The modulus can be colon seperated, spread over a number of lines, or contain arbitrary non hex characters such as "9D â® 79 â® BF â® E2 â® F4 â® 98 â®..." .  The datatype itself need not necessarily be expressed in cert:hex, but could use a number of xsd integer datatype notations, cert:int or future base64 notations. 
</p>
<p class="issue">Should we define the base64 notation?</p>
<p>If a <tref>Verifying Agent</tref> does not have access to a literal inferencing engine, then the modulus should be extracted from the graph, normalised into a big integer (integers without an upper bound), and compared with the values given in the public key certificate. After replacing the <code>?webid</code> variable in the following query with the required value the <tref>Verifying Agent</tref> can query the Profile Graph with</p>
<pre class='example'>
PREFIX cert: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/cert#&gt;
PREFIX rsa: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/rsa#&gt;
SELECT ?m ?e 
WHERE { 
   [] cert:identity ?webid ;
        rsa:modulus ?m ;
        rsa:public_exponent ?e .
}
</pre>
<p>Here the verification agent must check that one of the answers for ?m and ?e
matches the integer values of the modulus and exponent given in the public key in the certificate.</p>
<p class="issue"> The public key could be a DSA key. We need to add an ontology for DSA too. What other cryptographic ontologies should we add?</p>

<h2>Authorization</h2>

<p class="issue">This section will explain how a Verification Agent may

<h2>Secure Communication</h2>

<p class="issue">This section will explain how an Identification Agent and

<p>
If the <tref>Verification Agent</tref> has verified that the
<tref>WebID Profile</tref> is owned by the <tref>Identification Agent</tref>, 
the <tref>Verification Agent</tref> SHOULD use the verified 
<tref>public key</tref> contained in the <tref>Identification Certificate</tref> 
for all TLS-based communication with the <tref>Identification Agent</tref>.
