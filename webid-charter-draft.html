				WebID Incubator Group Charter
			</h1>
			<p class="mission">

				The mission of the WebID Incubator Group, part of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/">Incubator Activity</a>, is to further advance the <a href="http://webid.info/spec/">WebID protocol</a> for full standardisation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				WebID is an authentication protocol that uses the SSL/TLS layer for user identification by tying the client to a profile document on the web through placing a URI in the Subject Alternative Name field in an X509 certificate.  This is the first step to a fully standard-based browser authentication experience. Of course it is not limited to browser based authentication: peer to peer server authentication will work just as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				Research on WebID has been evolving since 2008 on the <a href="http://lists.foaf-project.org/pipermail/foaf-protocols/" title="The foaf-protocols Archives">FOAF protocol mailing list</a> and the  <a href="http://esw.w3.org/Foaf%2Bssl" title="FOAF+SSL - ESW Wiki">ESW Wiki</a>. What is required now is to pursue the work in a more structured environment, grow the number of interested parties from the Social Web, security and browser communities and integrate their feedback.

					Scope
				</h2>
				<p>
					Activities include:
				</p>

				<ul>
                    <li>to mature the WebID as a draft specification</li>
					<li>to compile a set of requirements and use cases for the WebID protocol</li>
					<li>to describe the WebID authentication layer</li>
                    <li>the <a href="http://webid.info/spec/">WebID protocol</a> is defined semantically with support for an extendible set of syntaxes, algorithms and ontologies - a minimum set of non-semantic requirements are however defined to guarantee interoperability between implementations. This means it can be deployed with profiles in any number of formats, such as <a href="http://portablecontacts.net/">Portable Contacts</a>, JSON or other... The WebID XG should try to work together with other groups working in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/socialweb/wiki/FederatedSocialWebCharter">Federated Social Web</a> space and see how existing formats can be WebID enabled.</li>


					<li>to describe and develop the relations between WebID and OpenID, OAuth and SAML bringing to bear the work that has already been done in this space by various universities</li>
					<li>to prepare the standardisation of the WebID protocol by bringing together people involved in authorisation and authentication activities and beyond, building on the existing WebID initiative</li>
					<li>to document existing WebID implementations and identify interoperability issues</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="may">
					<h3>
						Success Criteria

					<p>
					The WebID Incubator Group will be considered successful if at least the requirements and use cases as well as the interoperability report is delivered in time.

							All current WebID implementations function with TLS. The feedback and views of this TLS working group will be very helpful in a number of ways.

							WebID and OpenID both use a URI to identify a user. The methods for proving authentication are different,

					Participation
				</h2>
				<p>

					Professionals from Web software companies, relevant standardization organizations, universities, and research units are welcome to participate in the WebID Incubator Group. Members should be expected to introduce themselves and participate over the public mailing-list.

					Participants must be willing to attend the majority of the group's teleconferences and face-to-face meetings, and actively participate to the elaboration of deliverables.

			<div class="communication">

					Communication
				</h2>
				<p>
					This group primarily conducts its work on the public mailing list public-xg-webid@w3.org (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xg-webid/">archive</a>) . The group's Member-only list is member-xg-webid@w3.org (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-xg-webid/">archive</a>)
				</p>

				<p>
					Information about the group (deliverables, participants, teleconferences, etc.) is available from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/">WebID Incubator Group home page</a>.

					Decision Policy
				</h2>
				<p>

					As explained in the Process Document (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus" shape="rect">section 3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. When the Chair puts a question and observes dissent, after due consideration of different opinions, the Chair should record a decision (possibly after a formal vote) and any objections, and move on.
				</p>
				<ul class="example">
					<li>When deciding a substantive technical issue, the Chair may put a question before the group. The Chair must only do so during a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies.html#GeneralMeetings" shape="rect">group meeting</a>, and at least two-thirds of participants in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/groups.html#good-standing" shape="rect">Good Standing</a> must be in attendance. When the Chair conducts a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes" shape="rect">formal vote</a> to reach a decision on a substantive technical issue, eligible voters may vote on a proposal one of three ways: for a proposal, against a proposal, or abstain. For the proposal to pass there must be more votes for the proposal than against. In case of a tie, the Chair will decide the outcome of the proposal.
					</li>

					<li>This charter is written in accordance with <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes" shape="rect">Section 3.4, Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

					Patent Policy
				</h2>

				<p>
					This Incubator Group provides an opportunity to share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. 
					W3C reminds Incubator Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent disclosure obligations as 
					set out in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure" shape="rect">Section 6</a> of the
					W3C Patent Policy. While the Incubator Group does not produce Recommendation-track documents, when 
					Incubator Group participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working Groups, the
					patent disclosure obligations do apply.
				</p>
				<p>
					Incubator Groups have as a goal to produce work that can be implemented on a Royalty Free basis, 
					as defined in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/" shape="rect">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
					The W3C Team is responsible for notifying all Participants in this Incubator Group in the event that a new
					Working Group is proposed to develop a Recommendation that takes the XG Report as an input.
