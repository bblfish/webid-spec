WebID 1.0
Web Identification and Discovery

Identification and privacy have been at the center of how we interact with sites
on the Web. The explosion of Websites over the last decade and a half has 
created a point of pain for anyone that uses the Web on a regular basis. 
Remembering login details, passwords, and sharing private information across 
the many websites that people use on a daily basis has become more difficult and 
complicated than necessary. This specification outlines a simple universal 
identification mechanism that is distributed, openly extensible, improves 
privacy, security and control over how one can identify themselves on the Web.
